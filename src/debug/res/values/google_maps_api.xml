    TODO: Before you run your application, you need a Google Maps API key.

    To get one, follow this link, follow the directions and press "Create" at the end:

    https://console.developers.google.com/flows/enableapi?apiid=maps_android_backend&keyType=CLIENT_SIDE_ANDROID&r=BB:C2:67:CE:6C:8F:8D:41:59:40:F6:C2:35:4F:43:30:29:7E:51:CD%3Bcom.example.map

    You can also add your credentials to an existing key, using this line:
    BB:C2:67:CE:6C:8F:8D:41:59:40:F6:C2:35:4F:43:30:29:7E:51:CD;com.example.map

    Alternatively, follow the directions here:
    https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/android/start#get-key

    Once you have your key (it starts with "AIza"), replace the "google_maps_key"
    string in this file.
